msgid "Braiins OS+ is an operating system for ASIC miners. It is based on the `Braiins OS <https://braiins-os.com/community-edition>`_ product and provides additional proprietary algorithms for autotuning of miners. When a user provides maximum allowed power consumption in Watts, the system will automatically optimize the mining process to maximize hash rate. This process works across a wide spectrum of inputs, allowing you to optimize for the best possible efficiency or maximum hash rate based on economical considerations. Internal testing shows that for the Antminer S9, it’s possible to achieve efficiency of 70J/THs or even better for low Watts setting. For high power consumption, hash rate can increase by 20%+ (comparing to Antminer S9, 13.5 TH/s stock setting with ~ 94J/TH)."

We have found out that the cause was the Xilinx I2C controller core that we have integrated into the FPGA bitstream. We have switched to the I2C present in the SoC and the bitstream only routes the signal of the peripheral (IIC0) to corresponding FPGA pins."
